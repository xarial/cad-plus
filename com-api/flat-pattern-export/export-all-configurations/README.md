# Export All Configurations

This VBA macro utilizes the API of the **Drawing+\Export Flat Pattern** module and allows to export all bodies from all top level configurations of the active part document.

Files are exported in **PDF** and **DXF** formats into the **CAD++\\\[Configuration Name]** subfolder with the name of the source body.
